Hi! I am Harrison. Welcome to my homepage :) 

I am currently a Data Scientist at Bayer, primarily working on predictive and prescriptive modeling for Plant Breeding. 
I got my Master's at Cornell University in Operations Research and 
Bachelar's at UC Irvine in Mathematics. In my free time, I like to play basketball and travel with family and friends.
