## 1. Plant Disease Detection IOS App

<img src="/images/project_App_preview.png" alt="alt text" width="500" height="whatever">

Built and trained a CNN model to detect plant disease. And, deployed the model as a IOS app through CoreML by Apple.
([Code](https://github.com/harrisonzzh/Plant_Disease_Detection))

## 2. Natural Language Navigation for Simulated Drone

<img src="/images/project_sim_drone_preview.png" alt="alt text" width="500" height="whatever">

Built a recurrent neural network with self-attention mechanism for language embedding. 
Enabled the system to better capture key words in the human queries.

## 3. Simulated Self-Driving Car

<img src="/images/project_self_driving_preview.png" alt="alt text" width="500" height="whatever">

This project is building a self-driving program to drive a car on the Unity simulater ([link](https://github.com/blog/1395-relative-links-in-markup-files)).
The project used Nvidia self-driving car CNN architecture ([paper](https://images.nvidia.com/content/tegra/automotive/images/2016/solutions/pdf/end-to-end-dl-using-px.pdf))
and implemented with Tensorflow/Keras.([Code](https://github.com/harrisonzzh/Simulated-Self-Driving-Car))

## 4. Airline Pricing Optimization

<img src="/images/project_pricing_preview.png" alt="alt text" width="500" height="whatever">

This project is building a linear program to find the optimal policy in order to maximize the total network revenue. 
The linear program also considered the fare locking options so the customer can lock the fare for a certain time interval.

## 5. Image Search Engine

<img src="/images/project_image_search_preview.png" alt="alt text" width="500" height="whatever">

Our image search engine project (course project) will search for the most relevant images with given a natural language query. 
For instance, if a user types "dog jumping to catch frisbee," our system will rank-order the most relevant images from a large database.
