This project is building a self-driving program to drive a car on the Unity simulater ([link](https://github.com/blog/1395-relative-links-in-markup-files)).
The project used Nvidia self-driving car CNN architecture ([paper](https://images.nvidia.com/content/tegra/automotive/images/2016/solutions/pdf/end-to-end-dl-using-px.pdf))
and implemented with Tensorflow/Keras.([Code](https://github.com/harrisonzzh/Simulated-Self-Driving-Car))
